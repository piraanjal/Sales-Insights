# Sales Insights Dashboard ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data using Tableau. The primary goal is to derive actionable insights from the data to understand revenue and profit trends across different years, months, and markets.

## Data Integration ðŸ—‚
The analysis is based on five CSV files:
- *Transactions*
- *Date*
- *Market*
- *Products*
- *Customers*

These files were imported into a PostgreSQL database for seamless integration with Tableau, enabling efficient data querying and visualization.
